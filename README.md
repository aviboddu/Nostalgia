# Nostalgia
A 3D, First-Person game created for CSE 457

A mystery game from the perspective of a child. You play as a first person character that has broken memories of their childhood, 
so they look through a diary they worked on as a child to revisit their past. 
Specifically you will be exploring your childhood bedroom and bathroom.

Since the game takes place in the childhood diary, 
all objects in the world are made up of children’s drawings (drawings done by ‘yourself’ as a child). 
While the room, walls, and other items that aren’t prominent in memories aren’t drawn in, objects that are key to recovering memories are shown as drawings. 
The player will interact with the drawings in the world and piece together the hints to recover their lost memories.
